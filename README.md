# Portfolio Outline - Week 2 Homework

## Description

The task was to create a portfolio page that can contain future project work to showcase skills for employers. Portfolios are meant to highlight an applicant's strongest work and the thought processes behind it. Eventually this portfolio will link to deployed applications to highlight different areas of knowledge and strength to improve likelihood of hire.

## Application

The User Story stated an an employer would like to view a potential employee's portfolio of work samples such they can review the samples and assess candidacy for hire. 

The acceptance criteria required a deployed application that, when loaded, presented the employee's name, a recent photo, and links to different portions of the webpage as well as how to contact them. The links of navigation in the header were meant to direct the UI to scroll to the corresponding section, including a section about their work. The first deployed application was meant to be larger than the remaining. The cards holding the applications were meant to be clickable such that they redirect to the deployed application itself. 

Finally, the portfolio should demonstrate a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport when the page is resized to represent different screens and devices. 

## Background

The header and initial background image are formatted above the remaining sections to create a natural flow. The header presents my last name and three navigation links that, when clicked, will scroll to the corresponding section. The background it set to take up 100% of the webpage width so that it will resize for different screen sizes. It is a picture of me on the Bandera Mountain Hike in Washington State to bring character to my page. I added in an alternate image attribute that describes the location of the image should a viewer be unable to see the image.

## About

The "About Me" article was broken into an aside and two paragraphs. The aside holds the recent profile photo with an altrnate image attribute as well. The paragraphs were divided into my general background, both educational and perinent employment, and the reason I decided to take the UW coding bootcamp. The paragraphs were placed in a flexbox so that they wrap text when needed as the page is resized.

## Projects

I have created space for five different projects using the display grid format. Within the grid, the first project takes up the second and third columns as well as the first two rows to appear larger than the other four. All five of the projects have borders that light up dark purple with a box shadow when they are hovered over. Furthermore, all five projects will redirect the page to a different link when clicked on.

To resize the project grid for a mobile device, I added in a media screen for devices smaller than 400 px. I adjusted several things in the display to improve mobile device appearance including making the body display inline-block, the articles and contact me unordered list display block, removing the right side border of the asides, and adding padding to the grid cards.

## Contact

The Contact Me footer presents a title - "Contact Me" - as an aside and four links. The first link directs the user to a phone call, the second directs to an email address, and the third/fourth will open a new tab with my Github profile and my LinkedIn page. The links were spaced out within the footer using flexbox.
